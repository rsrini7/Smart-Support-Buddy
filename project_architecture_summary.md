## Components

### 1. Backend (Python/FastAPI)
- **API Endpoints**: For uploading MSG files, searching issues, linking Jira tickets, and managing issues.
- **Services**:
  - `msg_parser.py`: Parses MSG files, extracts metadata and attachments.
  - `jira_service.py`: Connects to Jira API, fetches ticket info.
  - `vector_service.py`: Handles vector DB operations, semantic search, and embeddings.
- **Database**:
  - SQLAlchemy models for issues, Jira tickets, and vector embeddings.
  - Uses PostgreSQL for structured data and ChromaDB for vector storage.

### 2. Frontend (React/Material-UI)
- **Pages**:
  - Home, Upload, Ingest MSG Files, Search, Issue Details.
- **Components**:
  - Header, Footer, and shared UI elements.
- **Functionality**:
  - Upload MSG files, link Jira tickets, perform semantic search, view and manage issues.

### 3. Jira Integration
- **Jira Server**: Runs in Docker, configured via setup files.
- **Integration**: Backend communicates with Jira via REST API for ticket info and linking.

### 4. Vector Database (ChromaDB)
- **Purpose**: Stores embeddings of issue descriptions and solutions for semantic search.
- **Admin UI**: Provided for managing vector DB.

### 5. Orchestration (Docker Compose)
- **Services**: backend, chroma, chroma-admin, jira, postgres.
- **Networking**: All services on a shared Docker network.
- **Volumes**: Persistent storage for Jira and PostgreSQL data.

## Data Flow

1. **MSG File Ingestion**: User uploads MSG files via UI or bulk ingest.
2. **Parsing**: Backend parses MSG files, extracts issue details.
3. **Jira Linking**: Issues can be linked to Jira tickets via backend API.
4. **Storage**: Issue data stored in PostgreSQL; embeddings stored in ChromaDB.
5. **Semantic Search**: User queries are embedded and matched against stored vectors.
6. **Results**: UI displays similar issues, details, and linked Jira tickets.

---

## Setup & Usage

- **Backend**: Start with `./start_backend.sh` or `./run_backend.py`.
- **Frontend**: Start with `npm start` in the frontend directory.
- **Docker Compose**: `docker-compose up --build` to run all services.
- **Environment Variables**: Configure DB, Jira, vector DB, and file storage in `.env`.

---

## Testing

- **Backend**: `pytest backend/tests`
- **Frontend**: `npm test` in the frontend directory

---

## Jira Setup

- Jira server runs at http://localhost:9090, configured via setup files and Docker volumes.
